    <hr>
    <h3>Front-end developers need to design sites that are engaging enough to nudge the target audience toward a conversion.</h3>
    <p>The front end is what you see on the screen — menus, graphics, and other features. You’ll also see the front end called client-side because that’s who is interacting with it. Front-end developers are primarily responsible for the site’s appearance.</p>
    <p>A front-end developer uses code that affects how a website looks and how a user interacts with its webpages. That includes simple elements such as buttons that take a visitor to different places within the website, as well as input methods, like a contact form. The programming languages that a front-end developer uses can create a static webpage or a dynamic one. Programming languages they use include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
    </ul>
