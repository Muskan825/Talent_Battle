With almost every business going digital, the need for mobile app development services is growing exponentially. And to acquire a bigger number of customers, businesses are developing native, as well as hybrid apps that perform similar functions on multiple operating systems.Considering the functionality and platform orientation in smartphone applications, subtypes of mobile app development have also stemmed out, including: native app development (Android and iOS app development), cross-platform app development, ecommerce app development, social media app development, and so on.</p>

            <h3>Desktop Software Development</h3>
            <p>Desktop software development refers to creating applications and software programs that work on desktop and laptop devices with Windows, Mac or Linux. Unlike web apps, these software solutions are stored on the local storage of a computer and does not usually require network connection for major functionality. Most of the desktop software programs (except video games) are developed to facilitate desktop users: individuals, professionals and businesses.Desktop software developers commonly use Java, C++, C# and Python for developing these computer programs. Microsoft Office is the most common example of desktop software development.</p>

            <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
            <p>Front-end development is process of creating the on-screen app features that an end-user interacts with. Programming the functions and workflow of the user interface is one of the major tasks in front-end development. While back-end development is for server-side, front-end development is called the client-side development as well.</p>

            <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
            <p>Back-end development is the process of coding and programming the server-side of a software. Back-end developers then create the core functional foundation of any application or program. As the name suggests, back-end is actually the back side of computer program or a mobile app that an end-user doesn’t see or interact with, but the major functionality and performance of a product depends on how robust the back-end is.The features, for example saving data and fetching results are the technical specifications of back-end development. If an app or computer program suddenly or repeatedly crashes while running, know that there are problems with the code in the back-end development of the program.</p>
